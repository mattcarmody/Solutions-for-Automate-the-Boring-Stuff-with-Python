# Solutions-for-Automate-the-Boring-Stuff-with-Python
Solutions for your viewing pleasure. But it's **strongly** encouraged you work through these examples on your own first! Get stumped, Google your problem, read StackOverflow posts, try again, get stumped again, go for a walk, give yourself time to work through the problem. If you're still stuck skip it and work on another project, then come back to it tomorrow. Once you've exhausted all your resources, THEN consult these solutions. 
Maybe you've come up with a solution that works but feels clunky or bloated. Maybe it just looks ugly. If you don't know how to improve it, check out what others have done here! Sometimes seeing how a few people approach the same problem opens up new ways of thinking.
### The Book
Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigert is a popular starting point for new Python users. It covers fundamentals, includes practical applications and it's widely available: in print, in video on Udemy, and online for free at [Al's website](https://inventwithpython.com/#automate). 
### Why Create This Page
When I was working through the book's exercises I would occasionally get stumped beyond frustration. I had exhausted my Google stamina. I needed some inspiration for the specific problem at hand. I found plenty of repos with solutions to a handful of problems, many of which didn't address the tough part of the project! At a point when I was already drained of searching, I had to do yet more searching. I'd rather you channeled more of your energy into the projects themselves, not picking through GitHub repos, so I'm putting this compilation together. I hope it helps.
